A little demo project to showcase the usage and the hybrid strict-dynamic CSP support of the [@next-safe/middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next-safe/middleware) package.



Strict-dynamic CSPs can't be evaluated with Next.js development builds. Serve a local production build with `yarn build && yarn start` to see the  strict CSP in action.

Or deploy to Vercel to see how it behaves in their edge network.
